Jmol/JSmol/GLmol filter for embedding interactive 3D chemical structures in the Moodle course management system.
The master branch and other recent branches use JSmol, the HTML5/JavaScript version, by default.
JSmol is supported on most modern browsers, has full functionality and performs well for all but the largest structures.
Users can also select GLmol, an experimental WebGL version.
If supported on the client, GLmol has better performance though is missing some functionality.
The 'original' Jmol Java applet may also be selected, though is becoming less useful as browsers drop support for Java.
MOODLE_2_STABLE branches use the Jmol Java applet with Moodle 2.0.x and later versions.
The MOODLE_19_STABLE branch uses the Jmol Java applet with Moodle 1.9.x and earlier.
The Jmol filter was originally written by Dan Stowell. Now maintained by Geoff Rowland.
